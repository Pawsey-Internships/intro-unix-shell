**key points**:
- The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
- Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
- Directories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree.
- `cd [path]` changes the current working directory.
- `ls [path]` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
- `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
- `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
- Most commands take options (flags) that begin with a `-`.
- A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
- An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
- Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows.
- `..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'.
