**key points:**
- Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.
- `bash [filename]` runs the commands saved in a file/
- `$@` refers to all of a shell script's command-line arguments.
- `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc.
- Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.
- Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.
