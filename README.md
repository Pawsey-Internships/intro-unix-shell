shell-novice
============

An introduction to the Unix shell for people who have never used the command line before.
Please see <https://pawsey-internships.github.io/intro-unix-shell/> for a rendered version of this material. 

The content is based on the Software Carpentries ["The Unix Shell"][https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/] workshop,
(github repo accessible [here][https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice]). However, the content has 
been substantially altered to fit the needs of the Pawsey Internship cohorts, and the workshop has 
been reformatted using hugo.
