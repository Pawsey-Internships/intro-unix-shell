shell-novice
============

An introduction to the Unix shell for people who have never used the command line before.
Please see <https://pawsey-internships.github.io/intro-unix-shell/> for a rendered version of this material. 

The content is based on the Software Carpentries ["The Unix Shell"](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) workshop,
(github repo accessible [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice)) which was forked in November 2021. 
However, the content has been substantially altered to fit the needs of the Pawsey Internship cohort(s), and the 
workshop has been reformatted using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
